# NLP_AMAZON
Natural Language Opinion Search Engine: a Python-based NLP system to search Amazon reviews with simple “aspect:opinion” queries (e.g. battery life:poor). Preprocesses text, runs baseline Boolean search, enhances relevance via sentiment classification and dependency parsing, and evaluates precision on example queries.
